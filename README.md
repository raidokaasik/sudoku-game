# Sudoku Game

Purpose of the task was to create a Sudoku Game

## Tecnologies used

Project was created with:

- React

## Revisioning notes

- Random Game generator needs improved back tracking algorithm, to generate very unique games. Current version sometimes has a game with more than one solution, thus
  validating results can fail.
- Removing Numbers from finished game after game-generator needs better logic to remove numbers from certain areas, to have more balanced difficulty levels.

## Setup

```
$ cd ../Sudoku-Game
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
